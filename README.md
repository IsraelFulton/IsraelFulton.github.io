# IsraelFulton.github.io

This repository contains the source for a personal website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site includes a home page, several standalone pages under `_pages`, and posts stored in `_posts`.

## Project overview

The site uses the Minimal Mistakes theme to present essays, project updates and other notes. Each page or post is written in Markdown and processed by Jekyll to produce the static pages served by GitHub Pages.
